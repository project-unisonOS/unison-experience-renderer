# Security

This renderer is part of the UnisonOS Operating Surface and is designed to run against local services by default.

For end-to-end security guidance (including wake-word, always-on mic, and privacy expectations), see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in the renderer, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
